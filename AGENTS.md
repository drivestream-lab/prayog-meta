## Harness (managed by launchpad — do not edit)

Installed under **`.harness/skills/<skill>/`** (hub) mirrored to **`.agents/skills/`** and **`.claude/skills/`**:

- Community: `/prd` @ awesome-copilot
- Prayog PM bundle @ **v0.4.3**: `/validate-requirements`, `/review-findings`, `/update-documents`, `/prd-impact-map`

Pin record: [`.harness-pin.yaml`](.harness-pin.yaml) (`profile: meta-pm`).

Re-sync after clone: `launchpad apply-harness --meta --apply`

### Delivery bootstrap

- Contract: **sdd-delivery/v2**

When asked “what next?”, read the latest persistent handoff and the pinned
workflow, then explain the current stage, blockers, and next candidate. Do not
perform file or GitHub mutations unless the user explicitly authorizes them.
